title: Smooth and efficient zooming and panning
authors: Jarke J. van Wijk, Wim A.A. Nuij
abstract: Large 2D information spaces, such as maps, images, or abstract visualizations, require views at various level of detail: Close ups to inspect details, overviews to maintain (literally) an overview. Users often switch between these views. We discuss how smooth animations from one view to another can be defined. To this end, a metric on the effect of simultaneous zooming and panning is defined, based on an estimate of the perceived velocity. Optimal is defined as smooth and ef??cient. Given the metric, these terms can be translated into a computational model, which is used to calculate an analytic solution for optimal animations. The model has two free parameters: animation speed and zoom/pan trade-off. A user experiment to find good values for these is described.
