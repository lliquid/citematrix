title: Surface Reconstruction Via Contour Metamorphosis: An Eulerian Approach With Lagrangian Particle Tracking
authors: Ola Nilsson, David Breen, Ken Museth
abstract: We present a robust method for 3D reconstruction of closed surfaces from sparsely sampled parallel contours. A solution to this problem is especially important for medical segmentation, where manual contouring of 2D imaging scans is still extensively used. Our proposed method is based on a morphing process applied to neighboring contours that sweeps out a 3D surface. Our method is guaranteed to produce closed surfaces that exactly pass through the input contours, regardless of the topology of the reconstruction.Our general approach consecutively morphs between sets of input contours using an Eulerian formulation (i.e. fixed grid) augmented with Lagrangian particles (i.e. interface tracking). This is numerically accomplished by propagating the input contours as 2D level sets with carefully constructed continuous speed functions. Specifically this involves particle advection to estimate distances between the contours, monotonicity constrained spline interpolation to compute continuous speed functions without overshooting, and stateof-the-art numerical techniques for solving the level set equations. We demonstrate the robustness of our method on a variety of medical, topographic and synthetic data sets.
