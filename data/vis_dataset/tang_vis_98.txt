title: Extremal Feature Extraction from 3-D Vector and Noisy Scalar Fields

abstract: We are interested in feature extraction from volume data in terms of coherent surfaces and 3-D space curves. The input can be an inaccurate scalar or vector field, sampled densely or sparsely on a regular 3-D grid, in which poor resolution and the presence of spurious noisy samples make traditional iso-surface techniques inappropriate. In this paper, we present a general-purpose methodology to extract surfaces or curves from a digital 3-D potential vector field {(s,v)}, in which each voxel holds a scalar s designating strength, and a vector v indicating direction. For scalar, sparse or low resolution data, we ???vectorize??? and ???densify??? the volume by TensorVoting to produce dense vector fields suitable as input to our algorithms, the Extremal Surface and Curve Algorithms. Both algorithms extract, with sub-voxel precision, coherent features representing local extrema in the given vector field. These coherentfeatures are a holefree triangulation mesh (in the surface case), and a set of connected, oriented, and non-intersecting polyline segments (in the curve case). We demonstrate the general usefulness of both extremal algorithms on a variety of real data by properly extracting their inherent extremal properties, such as (a) shock waves induced by abrupt velocity or direction changes in a flow field, (b) interacting vortex cores and vorticity lines in a velocity field, (c) crestlines and ridges implicit in a digital terrain map, and (d) grooves, anatomical lines and complex surfaces from noisy dental data.
