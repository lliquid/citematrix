abstract: We present some new methods for computing estimates of normal vectors at the vertices of a triangular mesh surface approximation to an isosurface which has been computed by the marching cube algorithm. These estimates are required for the smooth rendering of triangular mesh surfaces. The conventional method of computing estimates based upon divided difference approximations of the gradient can lead to poor estimates in some applications. This is particularly true for isosurfaces obtained from a field function, which is defined only for values near to the isosurface. We describe some efficient methods for computing the topology of the triangular mesh surface, which is used for obtaining local estimates of the normals. In addition, a new, one pass, approach for these types of applications is described and compared to existing methods.In general, there are two approaches to computing estimates of the normal, N(x,y,z), of an isosurface.1. The first is based upon the fact that the normal vector is the gradient of the field function. That is N(x, y,z) = OF(x, y,z) aFaF az Numerical differentiation approximations are then used to approximate the partial derivatives of (1). The method suggested in [6] is based upon a well known, second order, approximation of Zucker. First, the following approximation to the gradient is used to compute approximations to the normals at the lattice points: aF ax aF = ay 520656898995 (x, y, z) (x, y, z) (x, y, z).(1) )+F(i??? ??? k1, , )( 1, ,j k F i j
