title: Volume Clipping via Per-Fragment Operations in Texture-Based Volume Visualization
authors: Daniel Weiskopf, Klaus Engel, Thomas Ertl
abstract: We propose new clipping methods that are capable of using complex geometries for volume clipping. The clipping tests exploit per-fragment operations on the graphics hardware to achieve high frame rates. In combination with texture-based volume rendering, these techniques enable the user to interactively select and explore regions of the data set. We present depth-based clipping techniques that analyze the depth structure of the boundary representation of the clip geometry to decide which parts of the volume have to be clipped. In another approach, a voxelized clip object is used to identify the clipped regions.
