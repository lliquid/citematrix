abstract: In this paper, a novel approach is introduced to define a quantitative measure of closeness between vector fields. The usefulness of this measurement can be seen when comparing computational and experimental flow fields under the same conditions. Furthermore, its applicability can be extended to more cumbersome tasks such as navigating through a large database searching for similar topology. This new measure relies on the use of critical points, which are a key feature in vector field topology. In order to characterize critical points, ca and ) parameters are introduced. They are used to form a closed set of eight unique patterns for simple critical points. These patterns are also basic building blocks for higher order nonlinear vector fields. In order to study and compare a given set of vector fields, a measure of distance between different patterns of critical points is introduced. The basic patterns of critical points are mapped onto a unit circle in cv  ) space. The concept of Earth Mover???s Distance [1] [2] is used to compute the closeness between various pairs of vector fields, and a nearest-neighbor query is thus produced to illustrate the relationship between the given set of vector fields. This approach quantitatively measures the similarity and dissimilarity between vector fields. It is ideal for data compression of a large flow field, since only the number and types of critical points along with their corresponding cv and ) parameters are necessary to reconstruct the whole field. It can also be used to better quantify the changes in time varying data sets.
