abstract: Line integral convolution (LIC) is an effective technique for visualizing vector fields. The application of LIC to 3D flow fields has yet been limited by difficulties to efficiently display and animate the resulting 3D???images. Texture???based volume rendering allows interactive visualization and manipulation of 3D???LIC textures. In order to ensure the comprehensive and convenient exploration of flow fields, we suggest interactive functionality including transfer functions and different clipping mechanisms. Thereby, we efficiently substitute the calculation of LIC based on sparse noise textures and show the convenient visual access of interior structures. Further on, we introduce two approaches for animating static 3D???flow fields without the computational expense and the immense memory requirements for pre???computed 3D???textures and without loss of interactivity. This is achieved by using a single 3D???LIC texture and a set of time surfaces as clipping geometries. In our first approach we use the clipping geometry to pre???compute a special 3D???LIC texture that can be animated by time???dependent color tables. Our second approach uses time volumes to actually clip the 3D???LIC volume interactively during rasterization. Additionally, several examples demonstrate the value of our strategy in practice.
