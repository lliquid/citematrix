abstract: We present a new technique which enables direct volume rendering based on 3D texture mapping hardware, enabling shading as well as classification of the interpolated data. Our technique supports accurate lighting for a one directional light source, semi-transparent classification, and correct blending. To circumvent the limitations of one general classification, we introduce multiple classification spaces which are very valuable to understand the visualized data, and even mandatory to comprehensively grasp the 3D relationship of different materials present in the volumetric data. Furthermore, we illustrate how multiple classification spaces can be realized using existing graphics hardware.In contrast to previously reported algorithms, our technique is capable of performing all the above mentioned tasks within the graphics pipeline. Therefore, it is very efficient: The three dimensional texture needs to be stored only once and no load is put onto the CPU. Besides using standard OpenGL functionality, we exploit advanced per pixel operations and make use of available OpenGL extensions.
