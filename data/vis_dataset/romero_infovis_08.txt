title: Viz-A-Vis: Toward Visualizing Video through Computer Vision
authors: Mario Romero, Jay Summet, John Stasko, Gregory Abowd
abstract: In the established procedural model of information visualization, the first operation is to transform raw data into data tables [1]* The transforms typically include abstractions that aggregate and segment relevant data and are usually defined by a human, user or programmer* The theme of this paper is that for video, data transforms should be supported by low level computer vision* High level reasoning still resides in the human analyst, while part of the low level perception is handled by the computer* To illustrate this approach, we present Viz-A-Vis, an overhead video capture and access system for activity analysis in natural settings over variable periods of time* Overhead video provides rich opportunities for long-term behavioral and occupancy analysis, but it poses considerable challenges* We present initial steps addressing two challenges* First, overhead video generates overwhelmingly large volumes of video impractical to analyze manually* Second, automatic video analysis remains an open problem for computer vision*
