abstract: Conventional projector-based display systems are typically designed around precise and regular configurations of projectors and display surfaces. While this results in rendering simplicity and speed, it also means painstaking construction and ongoing maintenance. In previously published work, we introduced a vision of projector-based displays constructed from a collection of casually-arranged projectors and display surfaces.In this paper, we present flexible yet practical methods for realizing this vision, enabling low-cost mega-pixel display systems with large physical dimensions, higher resolution, or both. The techniques afford new opportunities to build personal 3D visualization systems in offices, conference rooms, theaters, or even your living room. As a demonstration of the simplicity and effectiveness of the methods that we continue to perfect, we show in the included video that a 10-year old child can construct and calibrate a two-camera, two-projector, head-tracked display system, all in about 15 minutes.
