abstract: We introduce a new approach for mapping texture on volumetric iso-surfaces and parametric surfaces. Our approach maps 2D images on surfaces while maintaining continuity and preserving the size of the mapped images on the models. Our approach is fully automatic. It eliminates the need for manual mapping of texture maps. We use the curvature of a surface at a point in order to continuously vary the scale of the mapped image. This makes our approach dependent only on local attributes of a point (position, normal and its derivatives) and independent of the global shape and topology of an object. Our method can map high resolution images on low resolution volumes, hence enhancing the visual appearance of rendered volume data. We describe a general framework useful for all surface types that have a C1 continuous normal. We demonstrate the new method for painting volume data and for mapping cavities on volume data.
