abstract: Remote experience of sporting events has thus far been limited mostly to watching video and the scores and statistics associated with the sport. However, a fast-developing trend is the use of visualization techniques to give new insights into performance, style, and strategy of the players. Automated techniques can extract accurate information from video about player performance that not even the most skilled observer is able to discern. When presented as static images or as a three-dimensional virtual replay, this information makes viewing a game an entirely new and exciting experience.This paper presents one such sports visualization system called LucentVision, which has been developed for the sport of tennis. LucentVision uses real-time video analysis to obtain motion trajectories of players and the ball, and offers a rich set of visualization options based on this trajectory data. The system has been used extensively in the broadcast of international tennis tournaments, both on television and the Internet.
