title: A Spreadsheet Interface for Visualization Exploration
authors: T.J. Jankun-Kelly, Kwan-Liu Ma
abstract: As the size and complexity of data sets continues to increase, the development of user interfaces and interaction techniques that expedite the process of exploring that data must receive new attention. Regardless of the speed of rendering, it is important to coherently organize the visual process of exploration: this information both grants insights about the data to a user and can be used by collaborators to understand the results. To fulfill these needs, we present a spreadsheet-like interface to data exploration. The interface displays a 2-dimensional window into visualization parameter space which users manipulate as they search for desired results. Through tabular organization and a clear correspondence between parameters and results, the interface eases the discovery, comparison and analysis of the underlying data. Users can utilize operators and the integrated interpreter to further explore and automate the visualization process; using a method introduced in this paper, these operations can be applied to ???cells??? in different ???stacks??? of the interface. Via illustrations using a variety of data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of this novel interface.
