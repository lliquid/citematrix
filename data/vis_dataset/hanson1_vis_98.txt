title: Image-Based Rendering with Occlusions via Cubist Images
authors: Andrew J. Hanson, Eric A. Wernert
abstract: We attack the problem of image-based rendering with occlusions and general camera motions by using distorted multiperspective images; such images provide multiple-viewpoint photometry similar to the paintings of cubist artists. We take scene geometry, in contrast, to be embodied in mappings of viewing rays from their original 3D intercepts into the warped multiperspective image space. This approach allows us to render approximations of scenes with occlusions using time-dense and spatially sparse sequences of camera rays, which is a significant improvement over the storage requirements of an equivalent animation sequence. Additional data compression can be achieved using sparse time keyframes as well. Interpolating the paths of sparse time key-rays correctly in image space requires singular interpolation functions with spatial discontinuities. While there are many technical questions yet to be resolved, the employment of these singular interpolation functions in the multiperspective image space appears to be of potential interest for generating general-viewpoint scene renderings with minimal data storage.
