authors: Ming Wan, Aamir Sadiq, Arie Kaufman
abstract: We present a fast and reliable space-leaping scheme to accelerate ray casting during interactive navigation in a complex volumetric scene, where we combine innovative space-leaping techniques in a number of ways. First, we derive most of the pixel depths at the current frame by exploiting the temporal coherence during navigation, where we employ a noval and fast cell-based reprojection scheme that is more reliable then the traditionalintersection-point based reprojection. Next, we exploit the object space coherence to quickly detect the remainingpixel depths, by using a precomputed accurate distance field that stores the Euclideandistance from each empty (background) voxel toward its nearest objectboundary. In addition, we propose an affective solution to the challenging new-incoming-objects problem during navigation. Our algorithm has been implemented in a 16-processor SGI Power Challenge and reached interactiverendering rated at more than 10 Hz during the navigation inside 512^3 volume data sets acquired from both a simulation phantom and actual patients.
