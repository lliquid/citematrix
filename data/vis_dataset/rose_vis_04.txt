title: Intuitive and Interactive Modification of Large Finite Element Models
authors: Dirc Rose, Katrin Bidmon, Thomas Ertl
abstract:  Virtual prototyping is increasingly replacing real mock-ups and experiments in industrial product development. Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understanding these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.
