abstract: We develop the first approach for interactive volume visualization based on a sophisticated rendering method of shear-warp type, wavelet data encoding techniques, and a trivariate spline model, which has been introduced [24] recently. As a first step of our algorithm, we apply standard wavelet expansions [6, 31] to represent and decimate the given gridded three-dimensional data. Based on this data encoding, we give a sophisticated version of the shearwarp based volume rendering method [13]. Our new algorithm visits each voxel only once taking advantage of the particular data organization of octrees. In addition, the hierarchies of the data guide the local (re)construction of the quadratic super-spline models, which we apply as a pure visualization tool. The low total degree of the polynomial pieces allows to numerically approximate the volume rendering integral efficiently. Since the coefficients of the splines are almost immediately available from the given data, Bernstein-B??ezier techniques can be fully employed in our algorithms. In this way, we demonstrate that these models can be successfully applied to full volume rendering of hierarchically organized data. Our computational results show that (even when hierarchical approximations are used) the new approach leads to almost artifact-free visualizations of high quality for complicated and noise-contaminated volume data sets, while the computational effort is considerable low, i.e. our current implementation yields 1-2 frames per second for parallel perspective rendering a 2563 volume data set (using simple opacity transfer functions) in a 5122 view port.
