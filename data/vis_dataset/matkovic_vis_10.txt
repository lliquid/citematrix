abstract: Multiple simulation runs using the same simulation model with different values of control parameters usually generate large data sets that capture the variational aspects of the behavior of the modeled and simulated phenomenon. We have identified a conceptual and visual gap between the simulation model behavior and the data set that makes data analysis more difficult than necessary. We propose a simulation model view that helps to bridge that gap by visually combining the simulation model description and the generated data. The simulation model view provides a visual outline of the simulation process and the corresponding simulation model. The view is integrated in a Coordinated Multiple Views (CMV) system. We use three levels of details to efficiently use the display area provided by the simulation model view. We collaborated with a domain expert and used the simulation model view on a problem in the automotive application domain, i.e., meeting the emission requirements for Diesel engines. One of the key components is a fuel injector unit so our goal was to understand and tune an electronic unit injector (EUI). We were mainly interested in understanding the model and how to tune it for three different operation modes: low emission, low consumption, and high power. Very positive feedback from the domain expert shows that the use of the simulation model view and the corresponding analysis procedures within a CMV system amount to an effective technique for interactive visual analysis of multiple simulation runs. We also developed new analysis procedures based on these results.
