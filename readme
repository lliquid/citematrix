CiteMatrix is an overview of the citation links among VIS conference papers (InfoVis, VAST, SciVis). The citation links are aggregated by the years and the venues of the papers. The columns show venue/year papers that are making a citation, and the rows show venue/year papers that are being cited. The sizes of the circles in the matrix are logarithmically proportional to the total number of citation links from papers in the selected venue/year column to papers in the selected venue/year row.

When you hover or click on one of the circles, the papers being cited, and the number of citations they received, are displayed to the right. You can also search by authors and the corresponding cells within the matrix will be highlighted.

This visualization helps the viewer to understand citation frequencies and patterns between and among the different conferences over the years.
